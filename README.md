# MNIST-Image-Classification-with-CNN
N
This project is a digit recognition application using a Convolutional Neural network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The application features a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with tkinter, where users can draw digits and get predictions in real time.
